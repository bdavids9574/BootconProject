# Overview
 ### Topic: Credential Harvesting using Social Engineering Toolkit
 ### Goal: Show how to open and navigate SET and show how to harvest credentials.
 
 ## Part 1- Social Engineering 
 
Before we can understand how to use Social Engineering Toolkit we need to understand what social engineering actually is.  Social engineering is defined as "Psychological tactic(s) that can manipulate people into taking certain actions or revealing sensitive information.  A prime example of this would be phishing emails.

## Part 2 - Why I chose SET

I chose to cover SET for my project because when I originally presented my idea of creating a USB keylogger I needed a way to make it execute.  This research led me to SET however due to time constraints for the presentaion a shorter demonstration was needed so I decided to demonstrate a simple task of harvesting credentials.

## Part 3 - Social Engineering Toolkit 

SET has a [GitHub](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/raw/master/readme/) with a [UserManual](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit/blob/master/readme/User_Manual.pdf)
The user manual defines the credential harvester Method will utilize web cloning of a website that has a username and password field and harvest all the information posted to the website.
